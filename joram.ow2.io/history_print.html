<h2>September, 2015:  JoramMQ/MQTT scales up to 750.000 concurrent connections on a simple VM.</h2>
      
<p>At the request of a user we conducted a study on the stability of JoramMQ / MQTT under stress conditions
      including a very high throughput of messages and an extremely large number of clients.</p>
      
<p>The goal of this benchmark is to demonstrate the vertical scalability of the JoramMQ server using a simple VM.
      The VM used during the tests was a 4 VCPU with 16Gb running CentOS7.1 with no Linux kernel recompilation. Under these
      conditions JoramMQ/MQTT has successfully handled 750,000 concurrent connections.</p>
      
<p>The MQTT 3.1.1 plugin implemented by <a href="http://www.scalagent.com">ScalAgent D.T.</a> is integrated with
      <a href="http://mqtt.jorammq.com">JoramMQ Entreprise</a> and is available for evaluation.</p>

<h2>October 9 2014: PRESENTATION AT JFSMA14.</h2>
      
<p>ScalAgent DT presents its technology at the <a href="http://jfsma14.lcis.fr/presentation-invitee-a-freyssinet/">22nd JFSMA</a>, a
      French conference on multi-agent systems at Loriol-sur-Dr&ocirc;me.</p>
      
<p>This <a href="http://jfsma14.lcis.fr/ressources/presentations/Slides_AFreyssinet.pdf">presentation</a> details the technological core
      of Joram: the distributed execution engine implements a reactor pattern, where agents communicate exclusively through events and react to
      events atomically. This technology enables ScalAgent‘s agents to interact effortlessly, be they located on the same system or on different
      ones.</p>
      
<p>It is at the core of several of our products, Joram or JoramMQ, the monitoring/control solutions developed for the CNES, or
      the mediation solution of TagSys RFID.</p>
      

      
<h2>September 18, 2014: CNES workshop - Mobility for operations</h2>
      
<p>CNES (the french space agency) has organized a workshop on 18th September about mobility for
      operations. The question is to allow remote users to use the services of an operations center from
      Internet. This could be for controlling a satellite, or for managing scientific on-board instruments.
      The topic covers also cooperative missions which involve several agencies and other entities.</p>
      
<p>David F&eacute;liot will be there for <a href="http://www.scalagent.com">ScalAgent D.T.</a> to present the
      interest of the MQTT technology in this context, and the value of the MQTT implementation in JoramMQ
      Entreprise.</p>
      

      
<h2>September, 2014:  MQTT implementation on top of Joram.</h2>
      
<p>
<a href="http://www.scalagent.com">ScalAgent D.T.</a> has implemented the version 3.1 of the
      MQTT protocol integrated with JoramMQ Entreprise. An intensive performance evaluation campain demonstrates
      the stability and scalability of the middleware, under stress conditions including a very high throuput
      of messages and an extremely large number of clients.</p>

<h2>May 18, 2010: JORAM Architecture Designer plugin 1.0.0 is available</h2>
      
<p>The first official release of Joram Architecture Designer plugin for Eclipse is available
      for <a href="download/index.html">download</a> (package JORAM_DESIGNER at
      the end of the page). A brief PDF installation guide is available for download.</p>
      
<p>As described in the <a href="doc/tutorials.html">tutorial</a> the designer
      allows to graphically build a Joram distributed architecture. It produces <code>a3servers.xml</code>
      and <code>joramAdmin.xml</code> configuration files. Now, it allows to automatically deploy the
      designed configuration using <a href="http://fdf.gforge.inria.fr/">DeployWare</a>.</p>

<h2>May 10, 2010: JORAM in OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative.</h2>
      
<p>Last week, OW2 Consortium members Bull, Orange and INRIA had announced the OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative
      at the Solutions Datacenter Management and Cloud Computing trade show in Paris. The bedrock of the OSC Initiative
      includes the following open source OW2 projects: CLIF, Entropy, JASMINe, JOnAS, and <strong>JORAM</strong> to provide
      the capability for on-demand JavaEE autonomic server provisioning according to demand fluctuations and ProActive for
      complementary heterogeneous capacity management.</p>
      
    
      
<h2>May 07, 2010: JORAM 5.3.1 maintenance release is available</h2>
      
<p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>A reworked PoolNetwork component with one Sender by NetSession. This optimizes
        performances and fixes various synchronization issues. Furthermore, SoftReferences
        are now used in the PoolNetwork to avoid memory errors when messages accumulate in
        the network.</li>
        
<li>Interceptors can now be configured for managed connection factories.</li>
        
<li>Bug fixes in JMS bridge allowing anew the use of persistent server (a configuration
        parameter is now required to enable XAConnection).</li>
			  
<li>Bug fix about destination using Timer. These destinations are now locked in memory
        and the Timer tasks are handled depending of the agent life-cycle.</li>
        
<li>Potential bug fix in heart-beat handling. Previously an exception in HeartBeatTask.start
        method caused an Engine stop.</li>
        
<li>Potential bug fix avoiding deadlock in AdminModule.stopServer of local server.</li>
        
<li>Changes configuration properties naming for NGTransaction.</li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>This version is available for <a href="download/index.html">download</a>, and in Maven

      messaging server:</p>
      
<ul>

        a classic Java program).</li>
        
<li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
