<h2>What JDK release does Joram need?</h2>

<h2>What are the components versions embedded in Joram?</h2>
    
<p>A file named versions in the SVN lib directory list the different versions used in the current release.
    Since 4.2.0 a copy of this file is shipped in the lib directory of each packaged version.</p>
    
      
    
<h2>How should I interpret Joram's version numbering?</h2>
    
<p>Joram is versioned with the scheme major.minor.patch.</p>
<ul>
      
<li>major: This number indicates the major version of the software, it is only changed
      for significant evolutions of the software.</li>
      
<li>minor: A change in this number indicates new or significantly altered features.</li>
      
<li>patch: This number changes for small changes such as bug-fixes.</li>
    
</ul>
    
<p>A protocol identifier is also available, it indicates the compatibility between two
    versions.</p>
    
    
    
<h2>What jars do I need?</h2>
    
<p>The minimal list of bundles to start a Joram server is monolog.jar, a3-common.jar, a3-rt.jar,
    jcup.jar, joram-shared.jar, joram-mom-core.jar and a3-osgi.jar. If you use the shipped JNDI service
    it is also necessary to add jndi-shared.jar and jndi-server.jar bundles. This represents less than
    one megabytes.</p>
    
<p>A set of possible OSGi configuration is provided with the samples in <code>samples/config</code>
    directory.</p>
    
<p>To start a Joram/JMS client you need monolog.jar, jcup.jar, joram-shared.jar, joram-client-jms.jar
    and a JMS API jar geronimo-jms_1.1_spec.jar for example. If you want to use the shipped JNDI service
    it is also necessary to add jndi-client.jar and jndi-shared.jar.</p>
		
    
    
<h2>How can I start a Joram server?</h2>
    
<p>In order to start a Joram server you just need to execute the AgentServer class with a correct
    a3servers.xml configuration file.</p>
<ul>
    
<li>
<code>java -cp .. fr.dyade.aaa.agent.AgentServer 0 ./s0</code>
</li>
    
</ul>
    
<p>Ant tasks, Windows and Linux shell scripts are available with the samples.</p>
