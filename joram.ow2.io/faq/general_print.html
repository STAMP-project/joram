<h2>What is Joram?</h2>
				
<p>JORAM is an open sourced implementation of JMS 1.1 as part of the J2EE specification.
					It provides access to a true distributed MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on
					top of the ScalAgent agent based distributed platform.</p>
				
<p>JORAM, the MOM it gives access to, and the Scalagent platform are open source softwares
				  and released under the LGPL license.</p>
			

			
<h2>Why use Joram?</h2>
				
<p>Message-Oriented Middleware is increasingly being seen as a key to improve the
					enterprise productivity and to facilitate the open services market. Today enterprises
					are faced with the challenges of time-to-market, data distribution, application integration
					and business flexibility in the context of loosely-coupled distributed systems encountered
					in multi-organization environments over the Internet:</p>
				
<ul>
					
<li>E-business, EAI and B2B solutions,</li>
					
<li>Telco management systems,</li>
					
<li>Networked devices management solutions: energy, building/home automation, etc.</li>
				
</ul>
			

			
<h2>What is the license?</h2>
				
<p>
					This software is open source using the
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">LGPL license</a>
					(GNU Lesser General Public License or formerly the GNU Library General Public License).
					The LGPL is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
				</p>
			

			
<h2>How is JORAM priced?</h2>
				
<p>JORAM is free software in both the gratis and libre senses.</p>
			

			
<h2>Can I get commercial support?</h2>
				
<p>
					Absolutely, see our <a href="../support.html">Support</a> page for information about
					commercial support.
				</p>
				
<p>
					You can also directly check the detailed description of
					<a href="http://www.scalagent.com/spip.php?article41">ScalAgent D.T. professional services</a>
					on JORAM.
				</p>
				
<p>
					JORAM is also supported as an open-source project, for general questions please join
					our <a href="mailto:joram@ow2.org">mailing list</a> or contact the development team at
					<a href="mailto:joram-team@ow2.org">joram-team@ow2.org</a>.
				</p>
			

			
<h2>What is JMS?</h2>
				
<p>
					The Java Message Service (JMS) API is an API for accessing enterprise messaging systems.
					It is a crucial component of the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE).
					If you need mor information see:
					<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/faq.html#what_is_jms">what is JMS</a>.
				</p>
			

			
<h2>What is MQTT?</h2>
				
<p>
					MQTT is an IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight
					publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small
					code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. Due to its small size and low power usage it
					is also ideal for mobile applications where efficient distribution of information is needed.
				</p>
				
<p>
				MQTT is used in 62% of IoT solutions and remains the IoT messaging reference protocol (see
				<a href="https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2018/04/17/key-trends-iot-developer-survey-2018#Consolidation_in_IoT_messaging_protocols">IOT Developer Survey 2018</a>).

				</p>
			

			
<h2>What is AMQP?</h2>
				
<p>AMQP stands for the Advanced Message Queue Protocol and is a specification for how
					messaging clients and brokers can interoperate. AMQP is a specification of a
					wire-level protocol for client to message broker communication. It is not a messaging
					system like Joram, but just a messaging protocol.</p>
				
<p>Joram has code in the sandbox for implementing AMQP v0.9.1, it is aiming to provide
					support for AMQP 1.0 once it is finalised, as well as other open protocols.</p>
				
<p>Through these protocols, Joram can support clients in C/C++, C#, Ruby, Python, Perl,
				PHP, etc.</p>
			

			
<h2>What is Stomp?</h2>
				
<p>Stomp is a simpler text based protocol which is designed to be very simple to implement
					in any language or platform (e.g. you can use a telnet client to communicate via Stomp).
					There are already clients for many languages: C, C++, C#, Delphi, Erlang, Flash, Lisp,
					Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, etc.</p>
				
<p>Joram supports Stomp since 5.4.0, see the corresponding
				<a href="../doc/tutorials/stomp/stomp.htm">tutorial</a>.</p>
			
      
      
<h2>Is Joram transactional?</h2>
      
<p>Yes. Persistent messages are handled by the Joram MOM in a transactionnal way
      providing atomicity and durability properties to the clients that request them.</p>
      
<p>The JMS client provides either regular JMS and XA transactions.</p>
      
      
      
<h2>Does Joram support store-and-forward?</h2>
      
<p>Yes, as a MOM Joram supports store-and-forward message sending.</p>
